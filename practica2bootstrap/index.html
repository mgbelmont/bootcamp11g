                                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since

                            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
                            a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                            and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                            no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
